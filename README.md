## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd omedata
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_api_key
```

4. Set up the database:
- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to SQL Editor
- Run the schema from `lib/database/schema.sql`

5. (Optional) Seed the database with dummy data:
- See `SEEDING.md` for detailed instructions
- Run `npm run seed` after setting up `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `.env.local`

6. Set up storage bucket:
- In Supabase, go to Storage
- Create a bucket named `dataset-covers`
- Set it to public

7. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Database Schema

The application uses the following tables:
- `profiles`: User profile information
- `roles`: User role assignments
- `datasets`: Medical dataset metadata

- `downloads`: Download tracking

See `lib/database/schema.sql` for the complete schema.

## User Roles

- **Superadmin**: Full platform control
- **Admin**: Technical/admin panel access
- **Moderator**: Approve/reject dataset submissions
- **User**: Submit datasets, comment, upvote
- **Guest**: Browse and search only

## Deployment
